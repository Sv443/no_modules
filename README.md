## no_modules
My attempt at making a script that recursively deletes all node_modules folders.  
It's horribly slow so please use something like [npkill](https://github.com/voidcosmos/npkill) instead.

<br>

### Usage
1. clone or download and extract this repo
2. install modules with `npm i`
3. run with `npm start`
4. enter the path to start from
5. a confirmation prompt will be shown before anything gets deleted
